# Simple JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my repository where I explore and create simple JavaScript projects. Below, you'll find a brief description of each project along with links to their respective folders.

## Projects

### 1. **Country Explorer**

   - **Description:** A basic web application that allows users to explore and retrieve information about countries. Users can search for any country, and the application fetches data from an external API to display relevant details. Additionally, users can get information about their current location.

### 2. **Exchange Change**   

   -**Description:** The Exchange Rate application allows the user to input two different currencies and an amount. After entering this information and clicking the "Exchange" button, the application utilizes the Exchange Rate API to perform a currency conversion between the selected currencies. As a result, the user is presented with the equivalent of the entered amount in the other currency.
